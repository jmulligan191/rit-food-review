put image urls for author_image_url in author/, then in the json refer to them like this
```jsonc
"author_image_url": "media/images/reviews/author/image.jpg",
```

for attachment images, put them in attachments/ and refer to them similarly:
```jsonc
"attachment_url": "media/images/reviews/attachments/attachment.jpg",
```
